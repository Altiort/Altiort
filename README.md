- 👋 Hi, I’m Ortenzi
- 👀 I’m interested in matlab scripts and functions, AI assisted materials development, composites design and structural evaluation
- 🌱 I’m currently teaching disciplines in advanced materials for thermal conservaiton and biocomposites
- 💞️ Collaborations: Actually, I am learning about Matlab sripts and functions, so I do not have so much to contribute.
